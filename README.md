Unique Data Structures
==

This is a repository for irregular data structure implementations written in C.

I have created this repo to practice my C. Since implementing all of the standard data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Binary Tree, etc.), are boring and overdone, I wanted to practice on new ones!

So far, I have:

* [Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)
	* A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 
* [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
	* In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. 
* [Doubly Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) [_needed for Queap_]
	* In computer science, a doubly-linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes.
* [Two Four Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933%E2%80%934_tree)
	* In computer science, a 2–3–4 tree (also called a 2–4 tree) is a self-balancing data structure that is commonly used to implement dictionaries.
* [Queap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queap)
	* In computer science, a queap is a priority queue data structure. The data structure allows insertions and deletions of arbitrary elements, as well as retrieval of the highest-priority element.
